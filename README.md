# 🧠 Xontra AI — Intelligent DeFi Layer

**Xontra AI** is an intelligent layer that sits on top of decentralized applications, especially DeFi platforms like DEXs, and turns complex blockchain interactions into simple natural-language prompts. It acts as a **personal AI agent for on-chain finance**.



## 🚀 Overview

Xontra AI revolutionizes decentralized finance by making complex blockchain interactions as simple as having a conversation. Instead of navigating through multiple interfaces, users can simply type what they want to do, and Xontra AI handles the rest.

### ⚙️ How It Works

#### **Prompt-Based Interaction**
Users simply type what they want (e.g. "Swap 1 SOMI to USDC with the lowest fees"), and Xontra AI translates that into the correct blockchain transactions.

#### **Wallet-Connected Execution**
After the user connects their crypto wallet, Xontra AI handles the full process: planning the best route, estimating slippage and gas, and building optimized transactions.

#### **AI-Powered Optimization**
It compares real-time liquidity pools, network conditions, and pricing data to choose the most efficient way to execute a transaction.

#### **Smart Contract Automation**
Once optimized, Xontra AI sends the transaction to the underlying smart contracts on the blockchain to execute.

#### **Post-Transaction Insights**
After confirmation, Xontra AI explains the result in simple terms and suggests next best actions (e.g. staking, reinvesting, or withdrawing).
